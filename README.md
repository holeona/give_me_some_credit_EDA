# Give Me Some Credit

This project is to help banks predict whether a person will experience financial distress in the next two years. The business goal is to determine whether the banks should grant a person a loan by a predictive model. In context, granting a loan to someone who will not be able to repay would translate into huge loss for the banks. It is crucial for the banks to predict delinquency before approving a loan to lower risks of granting uncollectible loans.

There are mainly three parts in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Simple Logistic Regression Model
